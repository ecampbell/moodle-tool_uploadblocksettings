Feature: Setting course blocks by uploading a CSV file.
    In order to standardise default blocks across courses
    As an administrator
    I need to be able to upload a csv file that sets blocks in a course

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname  | category | idnumber |
      | Course 1 | C101     | 0    | idnum1   |
      | Course 2 | C102     | 0    | idnum2   |
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username  | firstname | lastname | email        |
      | student1  | Sam     | Student  | student1@example.com |
      | teacher1  | Teacher   | One    | teacher1@example.com |
    Given the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user    | course | role       |
      | student1  | C101   | student    |
      | teacher1  | C101   | editingteacher |

  Scenario: Manager can upload a CSV file using the upload block settings plugin
    When I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Upload block settings" node in "Site administration > Courses"
    And I upload "admin/tool/uploadblocksettings/tests/fixtures/blocksettings_test.csv" file to "File" filemanager
    And I click on "id_submitbutton" "button"
    And I follow "Courses"
    And I follow "Course 1"
    Then I should see "Calendar"
    And I should not see "Participants"
